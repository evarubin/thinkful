Condition A: sufferer tested
true-positive: 98% = .98
false-negative: 2% = .02

Condition B: Non-sufferer tested
false-positive: 10% = .10
true-negative: 90% = .90

Actual incidence of total sufferers in population: .5% = .005

Suppose that the test is now administered to a person whose disease status is unknown.
Calculate the probability that the test will:

	1.	Be positive
	2.	Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's
	3.	Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's
	4.	Misclassify the person

1. Probability test will be positive:
.005 x .98 + .995 x .10 = .0049 + .0995 = .1044

2. Correctly identify a sufferer of Thripshaw’s
.98 probability that a sufferer is identified

3.  Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw’s
.90 probability that a non-sufferer is identified

4. Misclassify the person
.02 x .005 + .10 x .995 =  .0001 + .0995 = .0996
