â€” 1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
SELECT DISTINCT
    trips.duration,
	trips.start_station,
    trips.end_station,
	trips.zip_code
FROM
    trips 
JOIN
    weather
ON

WHERE 
weather.Events = 'Rain'
ORDER BY trips.duration desc
LIMIT 3

-- 2. Which station is full most often?
SELECT

stations.name,
COUNT(CASE WHEN docks_available=0 then 1 END) empty_count
FROM status
JOIN stations
on stations.station_id = status.station_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY empty_count DESC


-- 3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting
--at that station but ordered by dock count.

-- 4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains
--anywhere?
