AIR BNB Challenge: Oakland and SF
Note: Questions 1 and 2 answered using Oakland data.  Question 3 answered using SF data since calendar data was not available for significant period of time during period of analysis.  SF data was missing 10 calendar days of data and is noted in question.

1.  What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?
price per night:  "2800"
name:	"Panoramic Sky"
neighborhood: ”Panoramic Hill"
bedrooms: ”5”
beds: ”5”
bathrooms: ”4”
host: “Steffan"
host since: ”2011-04-14"
response time: “a few days or more"
response rate: “30%"
number of reviews: ”8”
rating: ”93"

--data is collected as of 2018-07-16
--remove $ symbol, commas, and .00 and convert to integer to get MAX
SELECT 
MAX(CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(price, '$', ''), ',', ''), '.00', '') as integer))

neighbourhood_cleansed,

2. What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?
Top 3 between 2017-07-14 - 2018-07-15:
Longfellow: 1518
Bushrod: 1345
Prescott: 1148

--data is collected as of 2018-07-16 and includes data from: 2017-07-14 - 2018-07-15
-- use # of reviews as a proxy for popularity.
--more reviews per neighborhood = more popular neighborhood.
--air bnb uses ratings metric to estimate occupancy rates per site
--NOTE: ratings are limited to time period: 2017-07-14 - 2018-07-15
--NOTE: listings are limited to "hosting_since" date beginning: 2017-07-14 or earlier
-- limits impact of influx of new listings into neighborhoods, but does’t account for impact of listings leaving air bnb

SELECT
listings.neighbourhood_cleansed listing_neighborhood,
count(*) count_of_neighborhood_reviews

FROM
reviews

JOIN
listings

ON
reviews.listing_id = listings.id

-- ratings within specified time period and listings hosted prior to specified cut off date

3.  What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? What about the busiest?
Cheapest time of year: January
Most expensive time of year: July and August
Busiest time of year: March

--data is collected as of 2018-01-10
--missing data for 2018-01-01 - 2018-01-09 may account for why January is "cheapest" time of year
--but does seem consistent with tourism patterns of travel
--data includes actual paid for nights, but also includes reservations for upcoming year that could be changed
-- or cancelled prior to those dates

SELECT 
strftime('%m', date) as 'Month',
count(*) nights_paid_for,
available,
SUM(CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(price, '$', ''), ',', ''), '.00', '') as integer)) monthly_spent_by_customers,
SUM(CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(price, '$', ''), ',', ''), '.00', '') as integer)) / count(*) avg_spent_per_night

FROM 
calendar_sf

WHERE 
date <= '2018-12-31' 
AND 
available = 't'

GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY nights_paid_for DESC
