The Monty Hall problem illustrates that under the given situation, you're 2/3 more likely to get the desired prize
if you switch away from the door you originally picked.

You were originally 2/3 more likely to pick a door with a goat behind it, not the desired prize.  In this case, after
Monty Hall eliminates the other goat door, he's basically showing you which door has the desired prize.  Probability says
that 2/3 of the time, you'll get the desired prize by switching doors.

Bayes' Theorem as it applies to the Monty Hall problem: If you've picked one door, what are the chances Monty will open
either of the two other doors given the condition that he knows which door conceals the desired prize?  He'll never pick the
door with the car behind it.
