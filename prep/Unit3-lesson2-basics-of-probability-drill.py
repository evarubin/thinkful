# 1. Calculate the probability of flipping a balanced coin four times and getting each pattern: HTTH, HHHH and TTHH.
# .5 * .5 * .5 * .5 = 6.25%

# 2. If a list of people has 24 women and 21 men, then the probability of choosing a man from the list is 21/45.
# What is the probability of not choosing a man?
# 24/45 probability of not choosing a man (choosing a woman)

 # 3. The probability that Bernice will travel by plane sometime in the next year is 10%.
 # The probability of a plane crash at any time is .005%.
 # What is the probability that Bernice will be in a plane crash sometime in the next year?

 # .00005 * .1 = .000005
 # .0005% chance she will crash sometime in the next year

 # 4.  A data scientist wants to study the behavior of users on the company website.
 # Each time a user clicks on a link on the website, there is a 5% chance that the user
 # will be asked to complete a short survey about their behavior on the website.
 # The data scientist uses the survey data to conclude that, on average,
 # users spend 15 minutes surfing the company website before moving on to other things.
 # What is wrong with this conclusion?

 # Small sample size along with selection bias - those who click on links may be prone
 # to staying on site longer than those who don't click links.
